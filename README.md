This container was made with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

## Scripts

Into the project directory you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) so you can view it in the browser. Once you do this Parcel creates a `dist/` folder in the root directory, if you want to custom the output directory, you can add the `--out-dir` flag to this script.
Parcel makes this process really fast, so you can start editing the *App Container* to view the changes.

### `npm run format`

Runs prettier format configuration on every `.js/.jsx` file inside the **src** folder. You can customize your prettier configuration by editing the `.prettierrc` file inside the root folder.

### `npm run eslint`

Runs eslint validation on every `.js/.jsx` file inside the **src** folder. You can customize your eslint configuration by editing the `.eslintrc.json` file inside the root folder.

## Customize

In case you need to add a new babel-plugin, you need to add it to the `.babelrc` file, so parcel can load it correctly.

## Test

This will be a feature, in a future push.
